# Unsupervised-Attention-Classification

The code is derivated from the following paper and github repository:

Paper: Residual Attention Network for Image Classification https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06904

Github repository: https://github.com/tengshaofeng/ResidualAttentionNetwork-pytorch

I extended the 2D network into the 3D network to deal with Overall Survival (OS) classification of patients with Primary Central Neural System Lymphoma (PSNSL) using 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
